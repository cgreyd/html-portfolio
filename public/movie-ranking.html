<h3>A Fish Called Wanda</h3>
<p>This movie is very funny and a classic. "British gangster George Thomason (Tom Georgeson) and his hapless aide, Ken Pile (Michael Palin), draft a pair of arrogant Americans, grifter Wanda Gerschwitz (Jamie Lee Curtis) and weapons expert Otto West (Kevin Kline), for a massive diamond heist. When the job goes badly, Wanda attempts to seduce George's stuffy lawyer, Archie Leach (John Cleese), to find out where George hid the diamonds. Meanwhile, Ken repeatedly attempts to kill an elderly woman (Patricia Hayes) who witnessed the robbery."</p>
<h3>The First Wives CLub</h3>
<p>One of the ultimate "girl power" movies that show women being funny, smart, and capable. "Despondent over the marriage of her ex-husband to a younger woman, a middle-aged divorc√©e plunges to her death from her penthouse. At the woman's funeral, her former college friends (Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton) reunite for the first time in nearly 30 years. When the three discover the reason for their friend's suicide, they realize that all of their ex-husbands have taken them for granted -- and deciding it's time for revenge, they make a pact to get back at their exes."</p>
<h3>Moana</h3>
<p>I love this movie for the music and the storyline. The scene witht he glowing stingray spirt of her Grandma gives me chills! "An adventurous teenager sails out on a daring mission to save her people. During her journey, Moana meets the once-mighty demigod Maui, who guides her in her quest to become a master way-finder. Together they sail across the open ocean on an action-packed voyage, encountering enormous monsters and impossible odds. Along the way, Moana fulfills the ancient quest of her ancestors and discovers the one thing she always sought: her own identity." </p>
